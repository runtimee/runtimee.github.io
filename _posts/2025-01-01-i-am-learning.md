Keep learning something new

1. ReactJS: [https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) Should I say this is the best ReactJS learning materical so far? This is the third time I tried to learn ReactJS in the past ten years and it finally clicked! Also, an interactive video walk thru, WOW!

2. Jekyll: [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) I'm tired of moving around best blogging services and concerned about losing more blog post (MSN, Blogger, Medium, ...). Github here we go!
